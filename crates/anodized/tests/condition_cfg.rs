//! A `#[cfg]` on a condition must gate the check in every build configuration.
//!
//! These tests are gated on `anodized_panic` alone, not on `all(anodized_print,
//! anodized_panic)` as the other panic tests are. That difference is the point: the guard was
//! once emitted only alongside printing, so a gated-off condition was still checked whenever
//! printing was disabled, and no test that required both flags could see it.
