# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **[anodized] `no_std` support** - Disable default features to build without the mathematical carriers; the default `logic` feature preserves the `logic` and `arithmetic` exports.
- **[anodized] Const function specifications** - Direct preconditions, postconditions, and invariants support constant evaluation and runtime panic checks, including owned outputs. Unsupported captures and printing modes produce explicit diagnostics.

### Fixed

- **[anodized-core] Const check span hygiene** - Generated guards and panics retain macro-origin spans, so consumer lint policies apply to authored predicates without treating instrumentation as user code.
- **[anodized] Core-only type refinements** - `types::Spec`, its marker macro, and non-allocating container implementations work without `logic`, including type-spec enforcement at function and field boundaries.

## 0.7.0 (2026 Sep 27)

### Breaking Changes

- **[anodized-core] Revised the public specification AST** - `Spec` is now `FnSpec`, `DataSpec`
  is now `TypeSpec`, and postcondition patterns are represented by `TamePat`. Parsing is now
  contextual through `Specified`, replacing direct parsing of a standalone function spec (#207,
  #209, #219).
- **[anodized] Simplified `try_call!` failure values** - `anodized::result::Error::{Pre, Post}`
  no longer carry a formatted diagnostic-message payload; `Post` retains the function output
  (#186).

### Added

- **[anodized] Opt-in, enforceable type refinements with `Spec!(...)`** - Mark function inputs,
  outputs, and fields to enforce their type specifications at their relevant boundaries.
  Input markers support the `out` and `inout` modes, and refinements compose recursively through
  references, slices, arrays, `Option`, `Result`, `Box`, `Vec`, and tuples (#191, #217, #219).
- **[anodized] More expressive postcondition output patterns** - `ensures:` bindings can now use
  irrefutable destructuring and move patterns, while preserving the value returned to the caller
  (#196, #199, #205).
- **[anodized-core] Trait methods support input patterns** - Trait function specifications now
  handle supported argument patterns when forwarding calls to their implementation shims (#162).
- **[cargo-anodized] `cargo anodized fmt`** - Added a Cargo plugin that runs `rustfmt` and
  `anodized-fmt`, with package, manifest, workspace, check, and verbose options (#215).
- **[anodized-core] Charon/Aeneas spec embedding** - `--cfg anodized_embed_specs` emits embedded
  specification items, and `--cfg anodized_charon` additionally marks supported preconditions
  and postconditions with Charon contract attributes (#212).

### Fixed

- **[anodized-core] `#[cfg]` on a condition is honored in every check mode** - The guard was
  emitted only alongside the printing path, so a condition gated off by its `#[cfg]` was still
  checked under `--cfg anodized_panic` without `--cfg anodized_print` (#192).
- **[anodized-core] Robust pattern handling in postconditions** - Fixed edge cases involving
  wildcards, `mut`, `@`, type ascriptions, references, and boxed values, with clearer compiler
  diagnostics for unsupported patterns (#199, #205).
- **[anodized-core] Function bodies and captures use the appropriate closure traits** - Bodies
  that require `FnOnce` compile correctly, while capture expressions remain mutation-free (#187,
  #202).

### Changed

- **[anodized-core] Invalid `anodized_*` configuration combinations now fail early** -
  `anodized_try` requires `anodized_panic`; spec embedding and discarding cannot be combined with
  runtime-check settings (#214).
- **[anodized-core] Runtime-check diagnostics again identify pre- and post-invariant failures**
  (#197).

## 0.6.0 (2026 Aug 08)

### Breaking Changes

- **[anodized] Revised function-spec syntax** - `captures:` now uses assignments (`pattern = expression`) instead of `expression as pattern`; the automatic `old_` capture binding is removed. Postcondition output bindings now belong to each `ensures:` clause, for example `ensures: |result| [condition_a, condition_b]`; `binds:` and `inspects:` are no longer supported (#173, #178, #179, #180).
- **[anodized] Tightened condition evaluation** - Preconditions and invariants are no longer written as closures, and condition evaluation must implement `Fn`, preventing mutations of captured state (#157, #163).
- **[workspace] Raised the minimum supported Rust version to 1.95** (#158).
- **[anodized-core] Reworked the public specification AST** - `PreCondition` is now `Condition`, postconditions store an optional pattern and expression, and parser terminology/types now use fields (`SpecFields` and `syn::FieldValue`) instead of arguments (`SpecArgs` and `SpecArg`) (#165, #178, #181).

### Added

- **[anodized] `try_call!` and `anodized::result`** - With `--cfg anodized_try` and `--cfg anodized_panic`, wrap a specified call to receive a `Result` that distinguishes precondition and postcondition failures. This enables fuzzing and property-based testing to discard invalid inputs without masking postcondition failures (#156, #158, #159, #160).
- **[examples] Property-based and fuzzing examples for binary search** - Added QuickCheck, proptest, and cargo-fuzz demonstrations using `try_call!` (#166, #167).
- **[anodized] Postcondition closure-array form** - A single output pattern can bind the return value for a group of postconditions, e.g. `ensures: |output| [first_check, second_check]` (#179).
- **[anodized-fmt] Array formatting and comment preservation in arrays** (#140).

### Changed

- **[anodized-core] Improved runtime-check instrumentation and spec embedding** - Checks now enforce `bool` results and use mode-specific configuration internally (#143, #151, #153, #154).
- **[workspace] Expanded CI coverage** - Added checks for test utilities and fuzz targets, including formatter fuzzing (#141, #142).

### Documentation

### Documentation

- **[anodized] README refinements** - Clarified project positioning, ecosystem fit, and relationship to existing efforts (#137).

## 0.5.0 (2026 May 28)

### Breaking Changes

- **[anodized] Runtime mode selection moved from Cargo features to compiler `cfg` flags** - Removed `runtime-check-and-panic`, `runtime-check-and-print`, and `runtime-no-check` features; use flags such as `--cfg anodized_panic` or `--cfg anodized_print` instead (#118).
- **[anodized-core] `Backend` became `Config`** - Instrumentation configuration APIs were renamed and cleaned up (#131).

### Added

- **[anodized-logic] Quantifiers `exists` and `forall`** (#115).
- **[anodized] Data specs on `struct` and `enum`** - `#[spec]` now supports data-level invariants on these items (#121).
- **[anodized] Loop specs on `for` and `while`** - Added loop invariant (`maintains`) and loop variant (`decreases`) support (#122).
- **[anodized-core] Trait spec narrowing** - `impl` trait methods can narrow trait-level specs, with checks in place (#124).
- **[anodized-logic] `int` type for embedding integer arithmetic in specs** (#127).
- **[anodized-logic] Material implication and opaque expressions** (#129).
- **[anodized] `cfg(anodized_discard_specs)`** - Allows dropping spec embedding while still compiling normal code (#130).
- **[anodized-core] `fn` qualifiers in spec annotations** (#133).

### Changed

- **[workspace] Introduced the `anodized-macros` crate** - Macro implementation moved out of the `anodized` crate and re-exported from there (#126).
- **[anodized-core] Embedded spec elements now use internal `fn __anodized_*` items** (#120).
- **[anodized-core] `instrument_fn` was generalized to work with function items across contexts** (`ItemFn`, `TraitItemFn`, `ImplItemFn`) (#119).

### Documentation

- **[anodized] README updates for loop specs and related guidance** (#122).

- **[anodized-core] `Capture.alias` became `Capture.pat`** - Captures now bind with full Rust patterns, not only identifiers. A pattern must still be irrefutable.
- **[anodized-core] `Spec` internals changed** - `Spec` now tracks source span and exposes helper methods such as `is_empty` and `spec_err`.

### Added

- **[anodized] Trait specs support** - `#[spec]` on traits and trait `impl` blocks, with compile-fail checks for unsupported placements (#71).
- **[anodized-core] Patterns in `captures`** - Destructuring in captures is now supported, e.g. `captures: expr as (a, b)` (#100).
- **[anodized-fmt] Experimental: New formatter package** - Added a dedicated formatter (CLI and library) for `#[spec]` attributes, including `--check` mode and TOML config support (#92).
- **[anodized-core] `SpecArgs` for permissive parsing** - Added a raw spec representation that can hold partially-valid specs for tooling workflows (#94).

### Fixed

- **[anodized] Preconditions no longer permit early function exit** - Preconditions are wrapped in closures to prevent `return` from escaping the instrumented function (#69).
- **[anodized] Captures no longer permit early function exit** - Each capture expression is evaluated in a closure to prevent `return` from escaping the instrumented function (#107).
- **[anodized-core] Improved `captures` diagnostics and parsing behavior** - Simplified parsing and clearer errors for invalid capture forms (#101).
- **[anodized-fmt] Preserve comments in formatted specs** - Comments inside `#[spec]` attributes are now preserved (with documented skip cases) (#106).
